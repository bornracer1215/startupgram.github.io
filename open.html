            <h1 class="head">Open Source: Building a Successful Business</h1>
            <br>
            <div class="para">
                <p>Back in 2003, when the world was recovering from the dot com crash, and there was no interest in businesses that had only eyeballs and no real revenue, I made an investment in a company called JBoss. People thought I was crazy, and the common question I was asked was “how are you going to make money if you are giving away the product for free?”.  JBoss went on to become the first successful Open Source investment since Red Hat, and it spurred a whole host of other investments after it showed how the model could work. At JBoss, we pioneered a new growth model, that today would become known as Product Led Growth. By giving away the software for free, the company had created viral adoption with over 5 million downloads. They had a tiny amount of monetization through training and selling documentation, but then Bob Bickel joined, and he got me involved. Together with the founder, Marc Fleury, and the rest of his team, we figured out a monetization strategy, and a powerful new sales model that was copied by every other Open Source company since then. Within two and a half years, we reached $67m in ARR. Red Hat liked what we had done and purchased JBoss in 2006. </p>

                <h2 class="head1">The importance of Footprint or Market Share</h2>
                <br>
                <p>Another powerful effect of using the free strategy is that it usually results in a far larger customer base using the free products, who become proponents for your company. This expanded footprint or market share can have a huge effect on the price that acquirers or investors are willing to pay for your company, as they recognize that even though these customers have yet to be monetized, they represent a great potential for future monetization. Twitter and Facebook are two perfect examples of this.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Another less well known example of this would be the recent high priced aquisition of SpringSource by VMWare. In that situation VMWare far over-paid for SpringSource if one looked purely at revenue multiples. But the real value of SpringSource lay in their large base of developers inside of enterprises that were strongly committed to the Spring free Open Source framework. VMWare realized that they could leverage that developer base to monetize a future PaaS (Platform as a Service) offering.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Another way of looking at the importance of footprint or marketshare is to recognize the importance of market leadership. In the tech industry, market leadership is usually self-reinforcing unless the company does stupid things to annoy its customers. Even if you have gained market leadership by giving away a product/service for free, the financial markets and acquirers realize that market leadership is worth a significant premium over niche players that may have more revenue.</p>
                <br>
                <p>The entrepreneurs and executives that fall into the “wrong” camp, are so focused on trying to extract the maximum dollar out of every customer, that they fail to realize that this only leads to very slow (and usually expensive) customer acquisition, and consequently a small footprint or marketshare.</p>
