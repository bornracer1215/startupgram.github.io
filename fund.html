Five Ways to Nail your Pitch and Win Over Investors</h1>
<br>
<p>This post is the first in a series, where we will provide real examples–the good, the OK, and the bad–of early stage pitch decks we’ve seen over the years here at Matrix Partners. We’ll share, slide by slide, what investors are thinking (but not usually saying) when you present. And, we’ll talk about the key questions you should be asking yourself when deciding how to create your pitch. Our hope is to help founders nail their pitches so they can more easily communicate their incredible ideas and find the right VC partners to help them grow their businesses. We’ll be publishing posts for each of the key sections of a pitch deck:
    <br>

1.Team
<br>
2.Company Purpose
<br>
3.Problem
<br>
4.Solution
<br>
5.Opportunity
<br>
6.Market Size
<br>
7.Business Model
<br>
8.Competition
<br>
9.Customer Acquisition Funnel
<br>
10.Traction
<br>
11.Financials
<br>
12.Appendix</p>
<br>
<p>The deck is the backbone of your pitch, and in this series we’ll be going through slide by slide to help you tune each one. But first we want to talk about your overall presentation, because no individual slide in your deck will make or break you. What’s most important is the overall impression you leave when you pitch. Founders with sales DNA get this intuitively, but some technical founders or those without sales experience tend to underestimate the value of pitching well. Instead they feel that the substance of the business speaks for itself. This is partially true, but being a CEO is selling (recruiting, fundraising, getting your first customers and partners) and showing you can do it well is a reasonable expectation from investors.</p>
<br>
<h2 class="head1">1) Tell A Narrative, Don’t Just Present Slides</h2>
<br>
<p>More important than the specific slides you present is how you weave them together to convince and inspire your audience that you are going to build a successful company. I’m not talking about a made up story or crazy theatrics. I’m talking about how you put the facts and data together to sell a vision. When investors understand and believe in you and your vision, it increases the value of what you’re selling.</p>
<br>
<p>You want your audience to feel like they’ve heard the vision and evidence, and have come to their own conclusion that this is a winning idea and team.

Your narrative will vary based on your stage, and primarily whether you are pre- or post- product-market fit. Your milestones in these stages are different and thus your pitch will be different. If you are pre-product-market fit, your story will center on the opportunity ahead, and the potential of your business to achieve it, perhaps through a killer product demonstration. If post-product-market fit, the story tends to focus on the results: “look at our traction, traction, traction. Here’s how we’re getting that and what we’re doing next.”</p>
<br>
<p>But, your pitch also needs to be tailored to your strengths as a business. It could be built around your team and how you’re a fit for the opportunity ahead. It could be all about your unique insights and take on a problem. It could be a product demo that wows everyone in the room. Or, as in the last example, it could be all about your product-market fit.</p>
<br>
    <h2 class="head1">2) The First Five Minutes Matter, You Need a Hook</h2>
    <br>
    <p>1. Show what’s changed – what’s the shift, breakthrough or innovation that creates an opportunity 
        <br>
2.Say what you do – one sentence about what you do to capitalize on that change
<br>
3.Give the fast facts – when you founded the company, your stage, number of employees, what you’re looking to raise. This gives context for the rest of the presentation.
<br>
I agree that you need to capture attention right away – no long preambles or you will lose your audience. These three slides are one way to get to the point quickly. But, whether you use these three slides or in this order, will depend on the narrative you are telling (see #1). Think about what is most compelling about your business and team, and build your hook there.</p>
<br>
<h2 class="head1">3) Listen and Respond To Your Audience & Use Both Audio and Visual Clues</h2>
<br>
<p>The best pitch is a conversation rather than a sales pitch. And, the best presenters have the ability to listen while they’re talking, watch the audience for clues that what they are saying is resonating, and then adjusting if needed. If you are seeing raised eyebrows and questioning looks, take note and clarify what you’re saying. You may need to push or pull back on the points you’re making.

As you talk, watch and listen to your audience and then adjust your pitch based on the clues you’re receiving.</p>
<br>
<p>Sometimes VCs won’t ask their questions – they know you’re trying to cover a lot in a short amount of time – but there will still be visual clues. You need to recognize these and address unvoiced questions or concerns because it is something they will bring up with their partners during the discussion after you leave the room.</p>
<br>
<h2 class="head1">4) Relate Your Story To Your Audience</h2>
<br>
<p>The best way to convince your audience is to frame the problem or solution in a way that relates to the issues they experience directly. This isn’t always possible, but for most consumer or B2B products, it is.Sketchdeck, who pitched (and got funded) by Matrix, is a good example. They offer outsourcing services for presentation design. Their pitchdeck is strong with a compelling intro and narrative, but possibly a more convincing way to frame the value they provide would be to build a story around a VC getting their own presentations completed: How long does it take you to build a presentation? Do you struggle with the design aspects? What if you could draft the story, provide bullet points, and have someone else (at a lower rate than your time is worth) come back with a beautiful presentation.</p>
<br>
<h2 class="head1">5) Be Confident But Honest</h2>
<br>
<p>You obviously want to present a very positive story and appear highly confident about your business. But, over confidence can be a big red flag. Investors are not just evaluating your business, but also what kind of person you are going to be to work with. Building a business is extraordinarily hard. For it to work, you need to be able to recognize potential problem areas and be open to getting help when you don’t have all the answers.

We understand hard challenges are part of building a business and we want to understand how you will lead your team through them.</p>
<br>
<p>If you are facing some tough issues, don’t avoid these, bring them up in the discussion. And, when asked tough questions, don’t hand wave or try to deflect. Tackle them head on. This is your chance, perhaps your only chance to address these questions. Hand waving doesn’t make them go away, it just makes your audience lose confidence in you and feel that you are trying to hide something.</p>
<br>
<h2 class="head1">Conclusion</h2>
<br>
<p>How you present matters, and in all cases it leaves investors with an impression – positive, negative or neutral. You don’t have to be a master of sales and public speaking, but you do need to be genuine, inspiring and convincing and you can do that by telling a compelling story and listening and responding to your audience.</p>
