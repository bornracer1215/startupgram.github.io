                <br>
                <p>Wow! is the moment in a free trial where your buyer suddenly sees the benefit they get from using your product, and says to themselves “Wow! This is great!”.  It’s also the moment where you have converted them into a fan who is likely to buy.</p>
                <br>
                <p>If you’re going to use free trial (or freemium) as a key part of sales funnel, it pays to understand exactly where in the free trial experience your buyer says “Wow!”. Then you will want to focus on the following set of questions:
                    <br>
                    <br>

1.How long does it takes to get to Wow!? (Time to Wow!)
<br>
2.Can we shorten the number of steps required to get to Wow!
<br>
3.What is the drop out rate of trial users on their way to Wow!?
<br>
4.Which step in the process has the highest drop out rate?
<br>
5.Why are users failing at that step, and can this be addressed?
<br>
6.Is the Wow! moment clear and strong enough?
<br>
7.What is the Wow! to Work Ratio?
<br>
8.Are different buyers interested in seeing different Wow! moments? (This is often the case in a product that has several modules.)
<br>
9.Are we providing the buyer with clear guidance on how to get to Wow!?</p>
