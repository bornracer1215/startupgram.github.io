                <p class="italic">“If you cannot measure it, you cannot improve it” – Lord Kelvin</p>
                <br>
                <p>This article is a comprehensive and detailed look at the key metrics that are needed to understand
                    and optimize a SaaS business. It is a completely updated rewrite of an older post. For this version,
                    I have co-opted two real experts in the field: Ron Gill, (CFO, NetSuite), and Brad Coffey (VP of
                    Strategy, HubSpot), to add expertise, color and commentary from the viewpoint of a public and
                    private SaaS company. My sincere thanks to both of them for their time and input.</p>
                <br>
                <p>SaaS/subscription businesses are more complex than traditional businesses. Traditional business
                    metrics totally fail to capture the key factors that drive SaaS performance. In the SaaS world,
                    there are a few key variables that make a big difference to future results. This post is aimed at
                    helping SaaS executives understand which variables really matter, and how to measure them and act on
                    the results.</p>
                <br>
                <p>The goal of the article is to help you answer the following questions:

                    1.Is my business financially viable?
                    <br>
                    2.What is working well, and what needs to be improved?
                    <br>
                    3.What levers should management focus on to drive the business?
                    <br>
                    4.Should the CEO hit the accelerator, or the brakes?
                    <br>
                    5.What is the impact on cash and profit/loss of hitting the accelerator?
                </p>

                <h2 class="head1">What’s so different about SaaS?</h2>
                <br>
                <p>SaaS, and other recurring revenue businesses are different because the revenue for the service comes
                    over an extended period of time (the customer lifetime). If a customer is happy with the service,
                    they will stick around for a long time, and the profit that can be made from that customer will
                    increase considerably. On the other hand if a customer is unhappy, they will churn quickly, and the
                    business will likely lose money on the investment that they made to acquire that customer. This
                    creates a fundamentally different dynamic to a traditional software business: there are now two
                    sales that have to be accomplished:
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    1.Acquiring the customer
                    <br>
                    2.Keeping the customer (to maximize the lifetime value).
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Because of the importance of customer retention, we will see a lot of focus on metrics that help us
                    understand retention and churn. But first let’s look at metrics that help you understand if your
                    SaaS business is financially viable.

                    The 3 Keys to Success in SaaS:
                    <br>
                    1) Acquiring Customers
                    <br>
