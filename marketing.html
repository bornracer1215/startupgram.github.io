                <p>This page contains some of the most popular posts on the topics of Sales, Marketing, Growth, and Go-to-Market. A great starting point would be to watch the videos listed at the top. They focus on the steps that are recommended to follow to build a repeatable, scalable and profitable growth process. The words repeatable, scalable and profitable are very carefully chosen. They are easy to say, but very difficult to achieve in practice. Once you have achieved them, you have the magic formula for successful growth, and are ready to hit the accelerator pedal.  Unfortunately there are many mistakes that are typically made along the journey to get there, and these videos highlight what those mistakes are, and how to avoid them. Some of the common mistakes include:</p>
                <br>
                <p>1.Using ordinary sales reps instead of pathfinder/trailblazer reps when you are working on finding a repeatable sales motion
                    <br>
                    2.Hiring a VP of Sales before your sales motion is repeatable
                    <br>
                    3.Trying to scale sales before your sales motion is repeatable.
                    <br>
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Even if your company is no longer a startup, these concepts remain just as important when you look at introducing new products alongside of the original product. We frequently see new products being thrown at the existing sales organization, and failing to sell. This is because there was no repeatable sales motion established for these new products, and an associated playbook to hand to the people expected to sell them. </p>
                    <p>Later videos focus on how to optimize your sales process by making it buyer-centric. (Buyer-centric sales processes delight your buyers instead of annoying them.) Also how to achieve Product Led Growth, using your product as your top salesperson. How to reduce the time and steps required for your customer to reach the Wow! moment. If you have already watched some of these videos, you may wish to skip to the last 3 videos on Building a Sales Team. </p>
